# Fine-Tuning Small Language Models
This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks for fine-tuning different small language models:

- `multi-modal-finetuning/phi-3-vision`: The Phi-3-Vision is a lightweight, state-of-the-art model capable of understanding multimodal data. It's designed to be efficient, with a smaller number of parameters (4.2B) compared to larger models, yet still delivers high-quality results. It supports long-context prompts up to 128K tokens and is built with a focus on safety and alignment with Microsoft's Responsible AI principles. Phi-3-Vision can be deployed on edge and cloud platforms. The Jupyter notebook found in the `multi-modal-finetuning/phi-3-vision` folder demonstrates how to fine-tune this model to identify and describe errors in boxing based on a photo. This technique can also be adapted to fine-tune the model for various fields, for example, car insurance, healthcare, etc.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your machine.
2. Go to the relevant folder e.g. `multi-modal-finetuning/phi-3-vision`
3. Open the README inside the relevant folder and follow the instructions.
